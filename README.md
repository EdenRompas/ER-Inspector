<h1 align="left">ER Inspector</h1>

###

<p align="left">ER Inspector is a custom Unity tool designed to help developers organize the Inspector view in a cleaner, more informative, and interactive way. With this tool, you can add visual elements such as titles, info boxes, or buttonsâ€”all controllable through simple attributes within your scripts. This tool is especially useful for improving editor workflows and clarifying the structure and purpose of variables or methods in a component.</p>

<h2 align="left">Features</h2>

###

<p align="left">Title<br>Adds a text heading above a variable, useful for grouping or highlighting sections in the Inspector.<br><br>Info Box<br>Displays an information box containing explanations or notes related to a serialized variable, helpful for documentation or usage guidance.<br><br>Show If<br>Conditionally displays a variable in the Inspector only if a specific boolean value is true. This helps keep the Inspector clean and only shows relevant data when needed.<br><br>Read Only<br>Makes a variable viewable but not editable in the Inspector. Ideal for displaying runtime data or values that shouldn't be modified manually.<br><br>Asset Only<br>Restricts variable assignment to assets only (e.g., prefabs, sprites, materials). It prevents scene objects from being assigned to the variable.<br><br>Scene Only<br>Opposite of Asset Only, this limits variable references to scene objects (Hierarchy), disallowing asset assignments.<br><br>- Button<br>Enables calling a method directly from the Inspector using a button, great for debugging or executing editor-side functions quickly.</p>
